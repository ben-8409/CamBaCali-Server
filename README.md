# CamBaCali-Server
Server Component for camera based calibration of large high resolution display walls.

# Abstract
This software is part of a software collection developed during my masters thesis at Bonn-Rhine-Sieg University.
The goal of the collection is to facilicate camera based calibration of Large-High-Resolution display walls. The server is the central part of this software collection. It ochestrates the smaller components and allows remote control using a web interface.

# Mission statement
I hope to make it easier to developed turnkey color calibration solutions via this framework. I release my code under a free license. If you find the software useful, consider to give back by contributing your knowledge or time.

# Third party code
This software relies on third-party Node.js modules. See the package.json for reference. Those modules are not bundled with the project. Use npm to install.
This software uses code from
- Forbes Lindsays excellent page on JS Promises (in lib/async.js)
